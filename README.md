Tesla’s stock prices have experienced staggering increases over several years and machine learning algorithms provide the means to unveil trends of seasonality or autocorrelated variables. Specifically, this project aims to address the ability of machine learning models to use the time-series data to predict Tesla’s future market behavior. This investigation will utilize machine learning techniques on the historical prices to evaluate the direction of market movement, as well as predict the value of the stock in the future. The research questions are as follows:

1.	How accurate is the ARIMA model with the addition of technical indicators from historical data?
2.	Which attribute(s) best predicts the direction of the stock market movement?  

This project features several stages in a typical data lifecycle:

* [Data Preparation and Exploration](https://cassandraczobit.github.io/Tesla-Stock-Prices/#data-preparation-and-exploration)
* [Calculating Technical Indicators](https://cassandraczobit.github.io/Tesla-Stock-Prices/#technical-indicators)
* [Modelling](https://cassandraczobit.github.io/Tesla-Stock-Prices/#modelling)
* [Feature Selection](https://cassandraczobit.github.io/Tesla-Stock-Prices/#feature-selection)
* [Performance Evaluation](https://cassandraczobit.github.io/Tesla-Stock-Prices/#performance-evaluation)

Two machine learning algorithms will be used for this project, ARIMA for forecasting the future value of the stock and K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) for classifying the trends in the market.
